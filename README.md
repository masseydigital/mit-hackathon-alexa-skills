Repository for MIT Hackathon for Alexa Skills.  For my skill I chose to utilize the Star Wars API to have Alexa read the title crawl of a given episode number in Wookie.  The Star Wars API has a wookie translator which I used along with some json regex to format the wookie speak into a format that Alexa understands.
